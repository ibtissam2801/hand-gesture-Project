# hand-gesture-Project

# Overview
projet_hand_195163.py is an advanced Python script for real-time hand analysis using a camera. Leveraging the capabilities of MediaPipe and OpenCV, this script is capable of performing complex hand gesture recognition. It is organized into different modes, each offering unique functionalities related to hand gesture analysis.

Finger Counting Mode: This mode allows the script to detect and count the number of fingers raised on a hand. It's useful for basic gesture recognition and counting applications.

Sign Language Recognition Mode: In this mode, the script can recognize certain letters in sign language. This feature makes it particularly useful for applications in communication aids for the deaf and hard of hearing.

Swipe Gesture Recognition Mode: The script can identify left or right swipe movements of the hand. This mode is ideal for developing intuitive gesture-based controls for various applications, such as navigation in virtual environments or controlling slides in a presentation.

# Usage
To use this script, a camera connected to your computer is required for capturing real-time video feed. The script will process the video stream, detect hands, and depending on the selected mode, perform the corresponding analysis.

# Requirements
Python , 
OpenCV ,
MediaPipe and
NumPy 
# BONUS
The script bonus_195163.py is an interactive Python application that employs hand gesture recognition for playing a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors ("Chi-Fou-Mi") with the computer. Utilizing the same hand tracking and gesture recognition techniques as the finger counting mode in projet_hand_195163.py, this script combines MediaPipe and OpenCV to create a fun and interactive game.
